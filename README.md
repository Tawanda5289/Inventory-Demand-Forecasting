#  Inventory Demand Forecasting and Analytics Dashboard

##  Overview
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to forecasting **retail inventory demand** using historical sales data. It combines **Prophet time-series modelling** in Python with a **Power BI dashboard** to visualise actual vs. forecasted sales and prediction intervals. The objective is to support better inventory planning, supply chain optimisation, and fulfilment efficiency.

##  Objectives
- Forecast weekly sales for a specific store and department using Prophet
- Visualise actual vs. forecasted values to evaluate model performance
- Display confidence intervals to highlight forecast uncertainty
- Generate business insights to support inventory and operations management

##  Key Features
-  **Forecast vs. Actual Sales** with dual Y-axes comparison
-  **Forecast Confidence Bands** visualised using shaded areas
-  **Forecast Error Analysis** using custom DAX measures
-  Interactive slicing by time periods
-  Business-focused insights to support supply chain and inventory decisions

##  How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open and run `prophet_forecast.ipynb` in Jupyter to generate `forecast_output.csv`
3. Load `actual_vs_forecast.csv` into Power BI using the `.pbix` file
4. Explore interactive visuals and apply filters
